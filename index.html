              <img src="personalpic/quan.jpg" alt="">
              <p>I am a first year RMIT student in Information Technology. I was born in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; so, Vietnamese is my mother language. I moved to Australia when I was 12 years old and have been living here ever since. I received my secondary education at the Indooroopilly State High school, Queensland and Viewbank College, Victoria. I have always been passionate about utilising technology to connect people and enhance education, particularly in developing countries. Apart from my interest in technology, I also enjoy music, cooking, photography, planes, trains, and video games in my free time. I love chatting with friends and learning more about what they are thinking about the world’s future. </p>

              <p>
                I was born in Carlton, Victoria, which makes me Australian. However, my cultural background and heritage lies in Greece where my grandparents were born and immigrated to Australia during the early 1960’s to escape from lack of jobs and poverty. Both my parents were born in Australia, the first-generation children of Greek immigrants but influenced by the Greek Orthodox religion and a retained culture that has followed Greeks wherever they move to many centuries. I do in fact speak Greek and understand the language, but I am not as fluent as my parents are, as they grew up with the Greek language with their parents more than I have. I have completed my highest education which was Year 12 at Emmanuel College VCE in 2021 with my subjects being English, Further Math, Psychology, Software Development (Applied Computing), VET Sport and Recreation and a bit of CISCO networking in Year 10. </p>

      <h2>Group Processes</h2>
      <div class="info">
      <p>For assignment 2, our group worked very well with each other. There were no conflicts between members, nor any issues with contribution to the assignment. The main issue we did come across while working together was organising meeting times and getting everyone to join a meeting at a time that suits all 4 of us, due to work, university class times or other commitments that prevent all 4 of us meeting at once. Hence, we are focusing on rectifying this issue in Assignment 3 by communicating through our Teams chat and in person our availabilities for the week. This includes the day(s) of the week we are free and the time periods. We understand that last minute commitments can arise, so if someone will not be available short notice, we can reschedule the meeting or fill in missing team members what we talked about in the meeting, either through Teams chat, in person or in the next meeting if it is not urgent.<p>

      <p>Another change in running our group we are introducing is a better representation of the tasks we need to do within Microsoft Teams itself. Microsoft Teams provides a function that you can add to teams called “Microsoft Planner,” which allows us to create tasks, place due dates, the people who are responsible for completing the task and indicate the importance of the task. Microsoft Planner is also great at reminding us that tasks need to be complete, as it sends email reminders to our Outlook accounts telling us that we have been assigned a task and if a task is due.</p>

      <p>As we neared the due date for this assignment, our lead project organiser (Romy) started making use of the commenting function in our Word draft document, using it to highlight sections that still needed to be completed or not started. This helped with further management of the writing portion of the project, and alerted team members to get certain sections completed. We hope by doing these changes, our group will be able to run more efficiently, and we will be able to have an idea of when we should be able to do meetings in advance.

          <h1>Quan Tan Bui</h1>
          <p>The ideal job that I want to be in the future is a Full Stack Developer. I have always been interested in developing apps and being a full stack app developer fulfils my interest. There are many pathways to reach my dream jobs, but I have chosen quite a safe route. During my study at RMIT University, I would try to get into an intern job at a tech company like Xero or Amazon to gain more real-world work experience and this would also help me build up my network of both junior and senior developer in the industry. Building a portfolio is also crucial for this type of job, I would first build a personal website to highlight my work with many fancy features for my future employers to see what I am capable of. Then, small webapp projects such as a to do list application or a note taking one or ambitious project such as a full-on language learning app with different users and interactions would expand my portfolio and show my employer the wide range of applications that I can develop. After graduating university, I would seek lower end development jobs that fits with what I want to do for my career such as a junior developer at a small start-up, the job can be outside of Australia as well since I know that the demand is not very high in Australia when comparing to Western Europe and North America counterparts. Being a full stack developer brings many flexibilities since you know the basic or even advance levels of the most widely used coding languages in the world. I could flex into being a web developer, mobile developer, backend, and front-end developer.

          <p>One of my ideal jobs was to become a senior cyber security analyst. However, being considered for a job like this will take several years of learning and experience. If I still want to go for a senior position in the future, after I graduate with my bachelor, I will consider doing a couple of years of work experience working in a cybersecurity field, to get an idea of the tasks I would need to accomplish, what skills I would need to have and what skills I would need to work on to be a better fit for a similar position. I would also aim to attain proper certification, such as getting a Certified Information System Security Professional qualification, an Intrusion Analyst certification and a Malware Analysis, Threat Hunting, Firewall Technologies, Networking and SIEM (Security Incident and Event Management) technology certification. These would all help to boost my chances of getting a job in the field as an applicant. If I do not decide to aim for a job like my ideal job, I would go in the direction of becoming an IT administrator or work as an IT specialist, system assembler or technical support for a business.

      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <h2></h2>
      <h2>Topic</h2>
  <div class="info">
    <p>The purpose of our project is to teach internet safety and cybersecurity in an interactive format. This will be presented in the form of games that are engaging and fun, while being educational. We want to encapsulate different security topics into this project and cover them in a way that users of the project will be able to retain and recognise the information, facts, and details that the games present. For the purpose of getting a working prototype / smaller version of what we envision this project to be, we want to focus on developing 3 different games in a website format that involve various aspects of internet and cyber security. These games will target internet users of all ages and experiences, whether they barely know anything about keeping their accounts and information safe to other individuals who are more aware about internet safety and/or it is importance while they are using an Internet hosted service or application. We are aware not everyone is tech savvy, so we want to accommodate for those who find internet security more difficult to understand by providing activities for all skill levels, and visual guidance of how to play our games and the importance of the information they will be learning from each game.
    </p>
    <p>We hope to achieve an outcome where users would enjoy playing the games our product provides, with positive engagement with most of our projected user base. We would like to be in a position where we can gather feedback based on user engagement and enjoyment, so this project can be improved and built on in the future. Users should be able to gain knowledge of internet safety and cybersecurity through this project, whether they have learned a little bit or a lot about the topics. For typical internet users who are not security focused, this should solve the lack of attention and awareness surrounding maintaining safety of accounts and personal information. Future employees or investors who believe this project has potential should recognise the way this project revolutionises the way ordinary people learn and retain security basics and more advanced topics that may be relevant to them.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <div class="info">


  <p>The motivation for this project is to be a resource to educate people about the risks and the consequences of not being able to recognise and protect yourself from cyber security risks like scammers and hackers. The project idea was born out of the lack of a simple and straightforward way to educate people about the world of cyber security and all the different methods that criminals could get access to your personal information and use it in an unlawful way. The importance of this project is significant due to the growing use and applications of the Internet and technologies that make use of it. Use of the internet and devices that are part of the Internet of Things framework are commonplace, with varying userbases and skill levels. No matter how someone uses the Internet, whether it is for social media, communicating with others, searching the web, online entertainment etc., internet and cyber security are crucial to maintaining the safety and trust of the users that are regularly using these services.
  </p>

  <p>We feel like many aspects of cybersecurity are simply overlooked by users. The typical user of the Internet would own several accounts for a range of services, whether it is a social media platform such as Twitter, to a communications service such as Discord, online shopping sites and even government services that have decided to create an online method of accessing information. Users are typically advised to create secure passwords, enable extra account security in the form of two factor authentication and not reuse the same passwords when making other accounts. But how many people follow this advice? According to an online security survey conducted by Google and Harris Poll in February 2019, 35% of users living in the United States do use a different password for all the accounts they own. This survey also gives an insight as to what security habits people of certain age groups are or are not aware of. 16- to 24-year-olds are “less likely to know what phishing means”, while those over 50 are “less likely to link recovery information to their accounts.” [1] (Google, 2019) This shows an example of the IT security trends in users that we should focus on improving and educating through our project.

  To a future employer, this would demonstrate the importance of having a method of teaching users of all skill levels and experience how crucial cybersecurity is, in addition to the consequences of not following crucial security advice or simply being ignorant towards the topic, thinking they will never get into any sort of security issue.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Landscape</h2>
<div class="info">
<p>There are many different educational ways of being safe on the internet. It is obvious everyone is using the world wide web. Learning about being tech savvy on the internet gives people the responsibility to know the tricks of internet safety and preventing cyber-attacks that can happen due to user fault. Only the user has a certain amount of control over these however, misleading information can result in quite a downfall for anyone. This may result in situations such as losing lots of money to scammers, sharing too much personal information which can lead to real-world threats like burglary or stalking.
</p>

<p>Anyone can be too naïve on the internet, from young adults to the elderly and even children as well who are using the Internet to play games or watch videos. All these potential problems can be circumvented by accommodating for different learning-styles, using educational games and potential educational material to be read if needed. The research we have gathered does show competitors we would similarly like to accomplish in our project but obviously not a replication of it. <a href="https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/en_us">“Be Internet Awesome”</a> is Google’s way to teach young children to be safe online wherever they travel in the online world. There is always fun to be found by being active on the internet as Google intends their users to understand digital citizenship and safety to ensure they make the smart decisions of being “Internet Awesome.” Next, Google has given a series of sections which covers the everyday usage of the internet as follows:
</p>

<p>“Share with Care.” Any kinds of information traverse the web rapidly, despite if it is awful news or uplifting news. Google has given them to kids to get them out of a tricky situation that may impact them. This module helps them to learn to share their data with people they do know and not share their data with people they do not know, and covers encouraging ways in thoughtful sharing techniques. Children will be able to learn to deal with online communication like face-to-face situations. However, if it is not correct to say, it is not right to post it. An important detail that not just children have a problem with is sometimes, they do not know how to keep personal details private. This as well involves in knowing when to be private and knowing when to go public.
</p>

<p>“Don’t fall for Fake.” This message focuses on our aim and goals which will be mentioned below. This section is all about helping kids be aware of situations online where things are not what they seem. Figuring out what is real, and fake is one of the important aspects of the using the Internet. This relates to scamming and being lured in by phishing into giving away personal information. By rethinking actions and choices, users will be able to learn to trust in their own judgement. Giving away personal information to “trusted” sources pretending to be (for example) a famous business is what they want you to do however, it is covered up by misleading you into thinking it is a fair deal.

<div class="page" id="description">
    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <h2></h2>
    <h2>Aim</h2>
<div class="info">
  <p>Our core aim for this project is to create an engaging and innovative way to teach people cybersecurity and internet security topics, information and how to keep themselves safe from threats, by identification and recall of the information they learn from the project. We chose this as our aim for the project due to our belief that current methods informing users how to keep safe on the Internet (by email, notifications, being taught in schools etc.) are not sufficient in an ever-growing online environment. Thus, we want these cybersecurity-based games to focus on user engagement, especially since our target user market is encompassing adults with children, adults themselves, the elderly, younger audiences, and those who may not have as much experience with technology. We want users to gain vigilance while they are actively using the Internet, to make sure they do not fall for any common ways for account or personal information to be stolen. Therefore, educating users to identify these tactics is crucial for our project to succeed as well.
  </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Goals to Achieve Our Aim</h2>
  <div class="info">
<p>Teaching the importance of internet safety: The users need to understand the games our project will provide are not just for entertainment, but for educational purposes as well. Thus, there is a need to preface the games by telling our users why they are learning what they are learning, which is internet safety and cybersecurity. For our users to become more mindful of their safety, they need to be taught why it is important. Before the users can play the games, they should be informed why knowing about these topics are important for those who are using the Internet daily. This should be taught in a way that accompanies those who may not be aware of the jargon, such as the elderly, some adults, and tweens, while still informing those who may be more tech savvy.
</p>

<p>Providing further explanations regarding the content the users are learning from the games: There would be no point making the games if the users do not understand what they are learning from them. Thus, when the users play each game for the first time, they will get a visual tutorial on how the game functions, and what they will learn from it. Answering questions will also allow the user to read more about what they just learned, even if they got the answer correct (for example, if they answer a question relating to phishing, the user can read an explanation on what phishing is, and if they are interested in reading more about the topic, they can Google it). This will facilitate the educational aspect of our project that we aim to provide. By encouraging our users to learn more about cybersecurity both from our project and further reading, this will allow our user market to reinforce their knowledge past what our project will be able to provide.
</p>

<p>Having some sample questions and activities ready for each of our game prototypes: Since this will be a prototype of our project, this will provide a fantastic opportunity to test how questions will function in each of the games, in addition to seeing if our ideas for cybersecurity focused games translate well into development. By having some examples of the questions that could be asked for each of the three games, we can focus more on getting the actual project in a working state, rather than focusing on all the possible questions we could ask. This way, we can gauge if we need to modify how one of the games works, modify the style of questions / scenarios to ask for each game, or even both of these if heavy adjustments need to be made. Investors and other teams that may wish to take over development of this project would need to see examples of types of questions we envisioned for each of the games we have made in the prototype, as a starting point. If they do not know what kinds of questions would work best with each of the games, the examples would act as a guide to help them formulate more questions.
</p>

<p>Teaching less knowledgeable users about cybersecurity through our project: The Internet is used by a broad range of age groups and user experiences. Since this project focuses on educating people about cybersecurity and internet security, it is crucial that those with less experience and knowledge are taught to a standard through this project. They will need to learn terminology, starting from the basics, and work their way up as they become more accustomed to the topic. Therefore, the games will have multiple difficulty levels. This will allow those who have less knowledge to start from the basics to begin with and work their way up to more advanced topics and scenarios that may or may not give them more of a challenge than when they started off with the easier questions. In order to accomplish our aim, this is a crucial goal to meet to educate as many internet users as possible.
</p>

<p>Have the prototype in a state where it is functional and reflects how we may want a finalised version of our product to look and feel: Again, if we were to pass the project on to another developer team, we want to leave our prototype in a state where our direction in terms on how we aim for the finished product to look and feel. The aesthetics do not necessarily have to be completed, but the backend and functionality for the three games we are working on should be present, to allow another team to see what we used for development, and who they need to hire or skills they need to learn to improve on what we made or develop more games for the project. If we were to sell our product to another development team, they would want to see a functional product that appeases our user market, and good reception by many users.
</p>

<h2>Plans and Progress</h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2>How we came about this idea. </h2>
<div class="info">

<p>Initially, this project idea was thought up by Romy. She noticed an increase in people falling for the same tricks and accounts being compromised causing people to lose their accounts in some of the social media and instant messaging apps she uses, notably Discord and YouTube. As someone who is safety conscious, she began to understand that there are still many people out there who do not realise how important it is to worry about cybersecurity and learning how to keep themselves safe on the Internet. Hence, she thought about this project idea, taking into consideration how people learn about new things, and the knowledge of internet safety and technology in general that individuals have, from not knowing much about internet and account safety to advanced knowledge of cybersecurity topics and ways that accounts and personal information are commonly stolen. She envisioned her Cybersecurity Games project as a way to innovate how people learn about these topics, in a more interactive way as opposed to reading words on a page to learn about cybersecurity, which may be complicated for some people.
</p>

<p>First, our Project began as an idea. Of course, like any project and/or idea we needed to have inspiration. Something to motivate us to make a change in the world that relates to our I.T solution to a problem. To create a safer, more pleasant, and more protective world was the inspiration we have found. So, we needed to decide on our plan. A plan to make an entirely safer generation and age on the Internet. The Internet has billions of device connections to the World Wide Web. We use the Internet as a great way to store data digitally and communicate to our friends and family. That is not all the Internet can do. There are lots of services that can be accessed online such as streaming services such as YouTube, National News, even Netflix and Disney Plus for all your favourite movies, shows, anything you can think of. There is even photo and video social sharing services such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat. The most important aspect about the Internet is that it will always be there forever. There are also the rules and laws that we have created for the Internet to remove certain content that is inappropriate, which may be harmful or not safe for minors.
</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">What our project will do and what our project’s games are</h2>
<p>We intend to use our Project Idea for user groups spanning from tweens and parents with young children who may not understand much about safety at their age, to elderly people who have trouble understanding technology. It will provide games for our users to play that are fun, but educational at the same time. The three games consist of a “decryption” unscramble the word game, a traditional quiz style game and an identification game that uses different scenarios based on internet safety. While the first and third games have a theme (encryption/decryption and internet safety respectively), all the games will teach our users a variety of cybersecurity and internet safety topics and advice to follow that is relevant to them. For example, teenagers are likely to have at least one social media account, so learning about how to keep safe on social media platforms may be more relevant to them.
</p>

<p>The first game will be an “unscramble the word/sentence” game that will focus on teaching users how to not fall for malware and scams, in addition to teaching them about various cybersecurity keywords or information. Depending on the chosen difficulty, the scrambled world will either be a word, a sentence or even an entire paragraph. The user will have a set number of mistakes (of their choosing) that they are allowed to make, from a maximum of 10 mistakes to 0 mistakes. For each letter in the scrambled (encrypted) string, the user will need to guess what letter it corresponds to in the unscrambled word / sentence / paragraph. For example, the letter ‘C’ in the encrypted string may correspond to the letter ‘A’ when decrypted. If the letter is in the string, but the user guessed it in the incorrect spot, the user will be notified that the letter is in a different position. If it is not there at all, the user will be told that the letter is not present in the decrypted string. If the user wants to put more pressure on themselves for a challenge, the user can choose to set a time limit. If the user makes more than the allowed number of mistakes or they run out of time, they lose. This game is inspired by popular word guessing games and the online daily word game Wordle.
</p>

<p>The quiz game is inspired by online quizzes you would typically see on sites like Buzzfeed, and games focused on general trivia like you would see in television game shows. The user will be presented with a question, which can be cyber security or internet safety related. The user will be prompted to pick the correct answer out of 5 different options and will have a time limit of 15 seconds to choose. There will be a hint system, that can be used once per question to help the user out if they are having trouble figuring out the correct answer. The user also has three lives, which are the number of incorrect guesses the user can make. If the user picks an incorrect answer, they will not be able to guess for the same question again and will lose a life. If all three lives are lost, the game will end. There will be bonus question milestones at every 10th question that if it is answered correctly, the user can choose if they want to regain a life or regain a hint. We would implement an option for users to tailor the questions to specific cybersecurity topics they would like to test their knowledge on, but this is out of our scope for this prototype.
</p>

<p>Examples of question formats that may be asked include:</p>

<p> - Description style questions where the user will identify what the description is relating to. For example: a description of a type of malware or software.</p>

<p> - Which is not (blank) style questions where the user identifies what is not correct, such as “Which is not something you should do to stay safe on the Internet?” or “Which is not a type of physical security?”</p>

<p> - What is a feature of (blank) style questions such as “What is a feature of a firewall?” or “What is a feature of a modem?”</p>

<p> - General e-safety questions such as “What is one thing you should do to stay safe while posting on social media?”</p>

<p>The third and final game we will present in our prototype focuses on teaching users how to identify suspicious links and executables. This game will allow the user to take their time answering the questions, so they can build up their identification skills. This will help those who may need more time to understand the scenarios, such as the elderly and parents who may need to explain the scenarios to their children. The user should learn from this game that they are the first line of defence when protecting their device from malicious software. Easier types of questions will involve scenarios that are more descriptive and straightforward. The scenarios should allow the user to easily find out whether it would be safe to access. There will be little clues that will help, such as a video having negative comments, a clickbait title, etc. Harder scenarios will give less hints towards if it is safe or not and may include links that may be misspelt. These harder scenarios encourage the user to take their time to look at finer details that may give hints whether the scenario is depicting a safe or suspicious situation.
</p>

<p>Of course, more games could be added, but this is outside our scope for our initial prototype. There is no guarantee we would be able to develop all 3 games in time as well, which is a limitation.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">How will we do it?</h2>
<p>Firstly, our team members will be given jobs to do according to strengths and their role in this project. Second, we agreed amongst our team members to hold at least one weekly meeting to catch up on our progress each week and plan for the upcoming week. During the meetings, we take notes on what we need to improve on the project and what we are happy with. We use Microsoft Task Manager to track what we have finished and what needs to be finished. Each member is assigned to a specific task on the platform. We also set out deadlines for sections that need to be finished before we start on another section. For example, designs and project details needs to be finished before we can start on development on the prototype itself. We also signed up for the GitHub student pack since we need some of the licenses that it has in order to work on the project.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">How far we went with development of our project</h2>
<p>We finished with the menu and landing of the project which is the most polished and has met all the requirements that we have set out. For the second game, which is a question-and-answer type of game is also nearly finished with one function which is adding more questions and answers in dynamically using an API. This was not able to be completed in our project prototype due to the complexity of developing a token security system to prevent online users from accessing our database. We also have deployed the website on to the Azure server and linked it with a domain name that we purchased. The design for the website is also finished and has been implemented into the final software as well. We could not complete the first game and third game due to technical and time constraints set out at the beginning of the project.  </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">How did this Project Begin?</h2>

<p>We began with starting our website design and development, as we were all aware these components would take the longest to create. With this, we decided on our main roles. Quan took the position as the lead developer of the project, making him responsible for the front end and the back-end development of the prototype. Alex became our game and web designer and had the responsibility of creating the mock-up designs based on our project idea, keeping in mind of the scopes and limits of our project. He worked together with Gauri, who helped with prototyping the design and creating designs for the written portion of our project. Finally, Romy took the role as lead project organiser, and was responsible for leading the group through meetings and checking in on progress with tasks. Next, we delegated writing sections between all four group members. We all decided to write on the Plans and Progress and Timeframe sections, as these sections were quite lengthy and needed information from all four members. Gauri decided to work on our template for the report and meeting notes, in addition to writing on the risks and comparison of our career plans. Alex wrote on the landscape, helped with creation of the timeline, and worked together with Romy to write the aim and goals of the project, as well as the scope and limits. Quan began by focusing his time on developing the back-end sections of the prototype.
</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">Were there any changes that were to made midway through creation of the prototype</h2>

<p>We had to scale down what we produced for the prototype for this project due to time and technical constraints. First, we decided to not develop the first and third game listed in the project description due to the complexity in producing questions and answers and the complexity in the development of it requires way too much time and added a lot of workloads to our already tight schedule. We also did not implement a database due to the technical difficulties of mapping out what kind of data structure we want and the type of database that we need to use to make a coherent system. This would require more thought to add and of course, more time to make a well thought out decision.
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">Decisions made during design and development</h2>
<p>With designs and motivation behind those designs, I really wanted to make the user feel like it was more of a game than chunks of text just being thrown at a person, for example, a boring scenario like “read this entire document/email and answer the following questions. Is this a phishing fraud? If so, why is it a phishing scam?”. A new internet user will not be able to understand what exactly they will be looking for as there is no information provided about a phishing scam. Therefore, we would like to make the user learn at their own pacing. Of course, there will be hints and tutorials on what to look for during each level they will progress to. Figure 1 inspired me to create a level-by-level design where the user can choose a difficulty based on their experience. There are no requirements for a locked level so inexperienced users will be able to have a go at tougher levels. An experienced cyber aware user without feeling restricted. Figure 2 has given the foundations for one of our games instead of safe sharing, we will be one of our games for finding out if this google website is pretending to be the "real google" so you have to differentiate between the two images. This enables recognition of popular webpages as it may force you to enter you personal information (figure 3). By looking at figure 3, you will be able to easily differentiate the 2 different webpages by clicking on the phrases or text that feel out of place and you will have to decide which webpage is real and/or fake. This motivates one of the game designs to be given a scenario where you must figure out by scoping out if this webpage and/or email (multiple different scenarious). Scamming itself has been seen as a huge uproar since Covid which is why we want internet safety learning to be fundamentally preparing youngsters and elderly.

<h3 style="text-align:center">What would another team want to know if they had to continue developing our project</h3>
<p>
  If we were to pass this project down to another team, it is important that they know what the original aim and goals are for development, as the project is still far from a finalised state. If the new team understands what we had in mind when we began development, and what this project aims to accomplish, they will be able to continue development with that in mind. That is, they know our original aim for this project is to create an engaging and innovative way to teach people cybersecurity and internet security topics, information and how to keep themselves safe from threats, by identification and recall of the information they learn from the project. The goals that the new team will have may differ slightly from our goals, or be different altogether, but if they have a baseline of how to work towards the aim from the goals we originally had in mind, they can base new goals off that.
</p>

<p>
  The new team would also need to know where we left off from development. We would need to tell them what we had made in the prototype so far, that is, one game, a rough design, and a backend for all the games to run off. This is so they can either improve on what we did so far or work more on prototyping the other two games we could not implement in addition to brainstorming more ideas for cybersecurity games if they wish. We may need to explain the game ideas we had to the new team, to see what they think and to ensure they understand our ideas. They can then decide to go with the ideas we had for games or rework them. The team may also want to know what roles we assigned each of our group members. Depending on if it is a smaller team like us, or a larger team, they may want to assign the same roles to their members or create new ones depending on what certain team members specialise in or skills a member has.
</p>

<p> Finally, the new team would need to know what tools and technologies we used for our prototype. The new team may or may not have members that specialise in the tools and technologies we have used, so this would be crucial for them to know. If the team does not have members that know the tools and technologies we used (for example, no-one knows how to use MongoDB, Node.JS, HTML etc), they will either have to recruit new members that have those skills, learn these skills themselves or modify what tools and technologies to use to other options that the team can use. If they do not want to spend time learning a new tool or technology, it might be better for the group to seek an alternative instead.

<div class="page" id="roles">
<h2>Roles</h2>
<div class="info">

<p>Lead Developer: Quan</p>

<p>As the lead developer, my role is to take the ideas and directions from the designers and leader and create a working product, I will also be responsible with any errors or bugs that occur during development and after release of the product. Maintenance is also one of my responsibilities as a lead developer, I need to ensure that the server is always in an operational state and keep the code up to date with all the latest technologies and platforms. The reason I was given this role is because of my experience and expertise in this area, I have worked with many of the tools and software that we are going to use for this project. My problem-solving skills that I have developed over the past few years also make me very fitting to this job since you are going to need these skills a lot when dealing with errors and bugs. I am also a great listener and always try my best to incorporate feedback from the team or clients to best fit their needs and wants. Time management and working under deadlines is also a strong suit of mine which will be beneficial for this project to maximise the most time possible under such a tight schedule due to the short time to work on the project and other commitments that the group members have outside of school.
</p>

<p>Game/Web Designer: Alex</p>

<p>As a game/web designer, my role is to give out mock-up designs that will help provides us the necessary ideas and actions to help build up the interactive game from the ground up including many different users' options without having to restrict support for all young to old internet users. The reason I got given this role is I am easily able to make up designs based on the system requirements and technical requirements needed to meet the users' expectations on teaching the importance of internet safety.</p>

<p>Lead Project Organiser: Romy</p>

<p>As the lead project organiser, my role is to direct my team regarding progress with the written and development sections of the project. I lead the discussion of our meetings, discussing what work has been finished, what needs to be started and what needs to be worked on. I allow my team to comment on their progress and ask questions if they are confused with something, so myself or the rest of the group can assist. I also help with editing written portions of the project. Organisation of the project is important as it allows our team to keep on track with work, have a sense of direction and know what tasks each member is responsible for completing.</p>

<p>Mock-up designer/Prototyping: Gauri</p>
<p>As a wireframe designer, my job was to keep the concept user-focused, clarify and defining the details of the website game features as they can be easy to create. I worked alongside Alex with his low to mid-fidelity mock-up designs. With my role as well for prototyping, the goal of this prototype is to test and validate ideas before sharing them with Quan. Using Figma, I have created a website prototype and eventually passing the final designs to Quan who will engineer and develop the game as best he can within the time constraints.</p>

<div class="page" id="scope+limits">
<h2>Scope and Limits</h2>
<div class="info">
<p>Our project mostly focuses on specifically instructing many groups of individuals in internet safety/cybersecurity, which is significant. Our scope is to allow many users to be able to self-learn in the form of very several interactive games. This learning style gives our targeted audience to mostly learn and be educated about cybersecurity in a more engaging way, rather than just a website and/or textbook boring white page filled with lots of cluttered pages of information that we do not learn too much from only reading, leading to people ignoring the importance of cyber safety. There needs to be an added variety of reading, auditory and hands-on experience so users get the most out of our self-learning models. Of course, this is not all we cover in our project. Our aim also focuses on user ability to recognise unsafe internet behaviour and common methods that can cause individuals to lose their accounts or get their personal information stolen. With how common it is for users to be naïve and fall for malicious tactics that are used to steal data, there is a dire need to educate internet users of all ages to be alert and be cautious about their actions. This can span from where their personal data is entered, to what and where users are downloading files on the internet, recognising ways to identify scams, etc.
</p>

<p>With billions of people using the internet in various ways every single day, an innovative way to teach cybersecurity is crucial to have, no matter how tech savvy particular users are. There should be something for everyone provided in this project, from simple, easy to understand tasks for novice internet users, to more challenging activities for more advanced individuals. The newer generation may be more aware of internet safety, but older generations such as the elderly and even older adult populations that are not used to modern technology may need more guidance.
</p>

<p>We will deliver one of our games in our prototype, which will be our quiz game. This considers the amount of time that we have to work on the prototype in addition to the tools and programming work our lead developer (Quan) needs to do. Some of the components Quan is using in his development are new to him, so he does need time to figure out how these tools function (hence his early start on the development in the first week of this assignment). Having one game completed would allow us to show the function of the backend section of our project and have a working prototype of how one of our games would work. We will create some examples of questions to ask for the game, however this will (of course) not represent the final number of questions and/or scenarios each game will include in a final build. None of the games will be a “final” version, and will only focus on working gameplay and functionality, rather than aesthetics and including all the features we would want in each game. This would be refined in a final build.
</p>

<p>Our limitations would be that we do not have enough time to make several different scenarios and a multiple variety of games which prevents us from giving the full experience of learning the safety of keeping users digital profiles secure and watching out for malicious software. It will take much longer to implement more games, due to the thought process that needs to be considered when brainstorming and developing each game (e.g. Do we have the programming skills required to develop and implement this game? Are the games too much like existing games on the market already? Will the game be able to accommodate a broad range of user experiences?). Due to the short amount of time and other assignments and commitments during this period, we are not able to complete all 3 game ideas we originally made plans for, but if we had more time or opportunity to work on this project, we would have created several other prototypes for the creation of these games.
